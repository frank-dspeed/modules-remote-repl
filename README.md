# modules-remote-repl
A Collection of Remote REPL Related ECMAScript Modules used in https://github.com/stealify for migration and porting of legacy apps. 

## Why?
There are a few generic extension points into legacy apps like nodejs, electron, nwjs, chromium you name it
The remote repl pattern got identifyed by me as usefull for the adoption and migration process of existing software
with less effort simply look at the module names and you will mostly directly know what to do.

If not this package is not for you at present you should dig more deep into the fundamentals so you understand the reason why this exists.
It is nothing that should exist but it is needed for a long time to give you a easy way to integrate. 

It is a bit like with the @stealify/filesystem module which exist for a similar reason to migrate legacy filesystem concepts and also hook into app development and runtime processes via the filesystem.
